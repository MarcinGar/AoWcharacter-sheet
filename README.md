# AoWcharacter-sheet
Self-calculating form for Art of Wuxia rpg 
# General info
This is a self calculating form that takes values from inputs and calculates rest of the stats. It's meant for my players, to help them calculate new character stats or modifiers for existing characters. I'm doing it as part of exercises that will hopefully refresh my knowledge about coding.
# Things to do:
- Calculation to keep some stats at 0 if they were calculated to have a negative value.&/n
- Adding dice roller with stats and skills as options, so you can test stats and skills and have results avalaible with one click.
- Changing info gathering method to be more dynamic,assigning values to array, then displaying them with iteration.
- Improving CSS.
- primary and secondary skills choice, so skills will get the bonus.
- Adding martial arts choices from data list or txt file, or online storage.
- Add techniques.
